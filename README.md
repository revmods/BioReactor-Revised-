# BioReactor-Revised-

fixed: glowers are bugged, the glower of the last placed bioreactor is applied too all previous bioreactors of the same type.

issue: during testing i encountered an error that had something to do with reserving pawns when there are multiple opened bioreactors, but i havent been able to reproduce this.
